# Using the tools we've learned in class 
# up to this point create blocks of code that will return a value.
#(you can use variables, data types, operators, etc.)

# 1. Create a block of code that uses the any of the arithmatic 
# operator and then print out the result.

# 2. Create a block of code that uses the AND operator and and then
# print out the result.
# always transform data into string 
# 3. Create a block of code that uses the NOT EQUAL operator and then 
# use then print out the result
number_A=int(input(enter a number 
number_a=int(input(enter another number ))  
#2 create a block of that uses the 
AND operator and and then print out the results
