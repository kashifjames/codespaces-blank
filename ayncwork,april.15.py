# Do the "try now" example provided on the article page and in your async document, 
# in your own words, describe what the range() function does. The range() function returns a sequence of numbers, starting from 0 by default, and increments by 1 (by default), and stops before a specified number.

  

# Prompt # 1 
# Create a python list of fruits. 
# Your list of fruits should contain mainly apples, organges,
# and a few other random fruits of your choice. 
# Once you have your list, create a python function that 
# uses a python For loop to go through the fruit list. 
# If the loop runs into a fruit with the value of apple, send 
# that value to a new list variable called apple list. If the loop encounter 
# a fruit with the value of orange, it should move the item to 
# a new list variable called orange list. Else, if the loop encounters
# any other fruit, it should move that item to a list called unsorted fruits.
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
fruits.append("orange")
a = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
b = ["Ford", "BMW", "Volvo"]
a.append(b)
