Create a new python document called weekendActivity_April_12.py and complete the 
# following questions. 

# This activity must be submitted no later than Sunday April 14th, by 11:59pm to be
# accepted. 

# 1. In your own words, describe the difference between a FOR loop and a WHILE LOOP

# A for loop is when  used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).
# A WHILE loop is when a   loop we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.

#Another example is a while loop is a block of code that a condition is true 


# for loop,grades,caculating,

#we need to add up all the grades and then divide
#to get the average
listgrades=(100,90,80,70,60,50)
 for grades in listgrades=0
#total score+grade
print(this is the total score)(totalscore)
numberofgrades=len(list of grades)
gpa=totalscore/number of grades
print(this is the class GPA)
print(grade)
print(totalscore)
print (this the class gpa (78%))


# 2. Why is it important to havve programs be able to repeat themselves? If necessary, 
# do research to assist with your answer- Please do not copy/paste a response, but rather
# express your answer IN YOUR OWN WORDS using complete sentences. 

# I think its important for programs to be able to repeat themselves is because they can have
a maintainable program so it could make it easier 

# 3. Create a function that uses a loop over the alphabet and print every 5th letter. 
# Write down clues, keywords, and breakdown and explain how you would approach this problem 
# in order to get full credit. 

# 4A. Use W3schools to learn about the range() function. Describe how what the range
# function is and how it works.  

#4B. Then, create a loop using the range function that will only print multiples of 3 between 1 and 30.
