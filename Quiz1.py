#3. Explain what complexity and abstraction are, then 
# provide an example describing their relationship to one another.
# You cannot use the following examples because they 
# were shared in class; grocery/ electronics store, car, phone.

print(kash...if)
whatisyourname()

#7. What is a function definition and a function call?
Function definition--> that would only run when called 

Function call-->excutes the instructions
