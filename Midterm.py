# Complete the following questions.
# Once you have comepleted your quiz, commit and sync your work to your GitHub. 

#RULES
# This quiz is open book; you may use your notes, google (only if you are viewing arcticles about python), W3schools only. Any other website
# is prohibitied.
# No phones are allowed during the quiz. refusal to put away a phone will result in failure.
# There is no talking during the quiz. If you complete the quiz, notify the instructor that you
# have finished. Once that is done, you are free to use your device and browse the web quitely. 

# Good Luck

# 1. In your own words, describe what the difference
# between a function arguement and a function parameter.   
# Write your response using complete sentences
#A parameter is the variable listed inside the parentheses in the function definition.
#A argument is the value that are sent to the function when it is called.

# 2. In your own words, describe what each of the following errors means.
# Write your response using complete sentences.

# syntax error means that the computer is unable to read your statment in code 
# type error means 	Raised when two different types are combined
# name error means Raised when a variable does not exist

# 3. What function would I use if I wanted to convert an integer data type into 
# a string data type?a = "Hello, World!"
a = "Hello, World!"
print(len(a))
I would use str()


# 4. What function would I use if I wanted to change a float data type into a 
# an integer data type?package main
import ("fmt")
package main
import ("fmt")

func main() {
  var x int = 500
  var y int = -4500
  fmt.Printf("Type: %T, value: %v", x, x)
  fmt.Printf("Type: %T, value: %v", y, y)

# 5. Describe three (3) Variable naming rules. Write your response in complete sentences. 
Legal variable names:
myvar = "John"
my_var = "John"
_my_var = "John"
myVar = "John"
MYVAR = "John"
myvar2 = "John"

# 6. Name the operator family each of these symbols are a part of 
# and describe how each of these sybmols are used. Write your response
# useing complete sentences. 

#symbols
# = =	x = 5	x = 5
# == 
Operator	Name	Example	Try it
==	Equal	x == y	

# =!!=	Not equal	x != y

# 7. You have been hired as an engineer to develop a car speed detection system.
# the car company would like to create a function where if the user goes over a certain
# speed it will notify them to change gears. The client has provided you with the following
# guidelines on how they would like the gear system to work:
# if the driver is going over 20mph, alert the driver to shift to gear 1
# if the the driver is going over 30mph, alert the driver to shift to gear 2
# if the driver is going over 40mph, alert the driver to shift to gear 3
# if the driver is going over 70mph, alert the driver to shift back to gear 1.
# the client would like you to pass in the speed that the user is going as an argument. 
# Please provide three (3) clues/ keywords and explain why you chose them to get full credit.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
#I would create a function if the user is going over a certain speed
#I would look at the gear system 
# would look at the guidelines 

# 8. You have been hired as an engineer to develop a fitness meal plan program. 
# your function should take in two (2) arguements; the day of the week, and the time of the day.
# depending on the time of the day; either morning or afternoon, the meal plan will change. 
# the client has provided you with the following meal plan information
# Please provide three (3) clues/ keywords and explain why you chose them to get full credit.

# i would make a function depending on time of day.
#the meal plan iformation

# monday morning= 2 eggs and an apple
# monday afternoon= bbq grilled chicken and broccoli

# tuesday morning= oatmeal with strawberries and blueberries
# tuesday afternoon= baked chicken with kale

# wednesday morning= fruit salad

# friday afternoon= cheesburger and fries

# saturday morning= oatmeal
# saturday night= baked chicken with string beans

# 9. You have been hired as an enineer to develop a school to develop an academic honors system.
# the client would like to check if the user has gotten above an 85% overall grade or has
# has accomplished passing the SAT. The client would like you to pass this information in as
# arguements. If either of these situations are true the student has made the academic honors list
# if only passing the SAT is true, congratulate the user but inform them they did not make the list.
# if they only scored above 85%, congratulate the user but inform them they did not make the list.
# if none of the conditions are met, inform them to continue studying and try again next semester. 
# Please provide three (3) clues/ keywords and explain why you chose them to get full credit.

# I would create a function or code to solve it
# 10.
